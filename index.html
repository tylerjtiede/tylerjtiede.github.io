            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience.<br>
                I also have a youtube channel and play professional disc golf.<br>
                Below are some projects I have worked on.

                <p>
                    This is a script that collects data from a user's 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pdga.com/player/178379">pdga profile</a> and uses the data to predict their rating at the next ratings update.
                    Many people, including myself, have made spreadsheets to track this, or even browser extensions, but they all required manually entering in new rounds.
                    This script checks things like "Now Playing", "Recent Events", or discrepancies between the player statistics page and ratings detail page to determine your next rating without manually entering any rounds.
                    As long as you have played a tournament, and the rating is accessible on the webpage, it will automatically use it to calculate your next rating change.
                    Additionally, it will show you which rounds you are adding and dropping at the next update. Further development of this will include more features, and possibly be hosted on a webpage for others to use.

                <h3 class="project-title">Arduino/Raspberry Pi Weather Station</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a project I worked on in 2020–2021 during undergrad.<br>
                    I'll give a brief description of the project here:<br><br>

                    I bought <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901">weather sensors</a> from SparkFun,
                    along with its accompanying <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13956">weather shield</a>.
                    I connected these to an Arduino and ran some code which collected data and spit it out in the serial monitor periodically.
                    I had the Arduino connected and being powered by a Raspberry Pi.<br><br>

                    On the Pi, I wrote a Python script that would take the data coming out of the serial monitor and write it to a text file.
                    Then, using a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://weewx.com/">WeeWX</a> to collect the data.
                    I used a method in WeeWX called "fileparse" which basically takes the data from the text file and sends it to a server.
                    This data is then presented on a local site using WeeWX's default interface using Apache.<br><br>

                    I had more plans for the project but this is where I left off since I graduated and could no longer work on it.
                    Later plans included adding support to the station so it would last in more severe weather conditions,
                    connecting it to a battery, solar panel, and possibly some other software improvements to get more data or improve the interface.

                <h3 class="project-title">Twitter Bot</h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <img src="images/twitterbotpage2.png" alt="Screenshot of Twitter Bot Page">
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is a Twitter bot that posts images every hour from the subreddit 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Ooer/">/r/ooer</a>.<br>
                    Most of the posts are complete nonsense; I just wanted to learn how to make a bot in Python using the Twitter and Reddit API.<br>
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ooerbotplease">Here's</a> the link to the actual Twitter bot page.
