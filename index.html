        </div>
            <div class="text">
                I am a recent college grad with a BS in Applied Physics from SUNY Geneseo.
                I am interested in software development and electronics.
                During undergrad, the projects I enjoyed most were ones where I could either work with electroncs or write code.
                My goal now is to work on projects that broaden my knowledge in those fields.
                Hopefully with this I can either continue my education to either MS or PhD, and/or become an engineer in either of these fields.

                Arduino/Raspberry Pi Weather Station
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                This is a project I worked on in 2020-2021, which unfortunately I didn't quite finish.
                Also unfortunately, since I was busy with finals before graduating,
                I forgot to document my work and left everything in a locked room somewhere at SUNY Geneseo.
                All I have left is a .ino file that I made in the early stages of the project.
                <br>
                I'll give a brief description of the project here:
                <br>
                I bought <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901">weather sensors</a> off of sparkfun,
                along with its accompanying <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13956">weather sheild</a>.
                I connnected these to an arduino and ran some code which collected data and spit it out in the serial monitor periodically.
                I had the arduino connected and being powered by a raspberry pi.
                On the pi, I wrote a python script that would take the data coming out of the serial monitor and write it to a text file.
                Then, using a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://weewx.com/">WeeWX</a> to collect the data.
                I used a method in WeeWX called "fileparse" which basically takes the data from the text file and sends it to a server.
                This data is then presented on a local site using WeeWX's default interface using apache.
                <br>
                I had more plans for the project but this is where I left off.
                Later plans included adding support to the station so it would last in more severe weather conditions,
                connecting it to a battery, solar panel, and possibly some other software improvements to get more data or improve the interface.

                Most of the posts are complete nonsense; I just wanted to learn how to make a bot in python using twitter and reddit api.

                Minecraft Mod (WIP)

                I've played Minecraft since alpha, so I figured it would be fun to make a mod.
                Right now it is just a work in progress, however I will probably add miscellanious features as I learn the process.
                This is mostly a project so I can get more familiar with Java and OOP.
                There is no real direction to the project, more of a sandbox project for me to mess around with.

                Tea Timer (WIP)
            </div>
                
            <div class="text">
                I haven't actually started this, but I am putting this here so I remember to work on it.
                The tea timer is pretty simple.
                You enter different teas into the app, and it saves them with whatever values you enter.
                Then, when you load the tea, it tells you what temp to steep it with, how long to steep it, and sets up a timer.
                This project helps me work on how to set up a GUI in python.
