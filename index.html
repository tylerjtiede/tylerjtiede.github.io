        </div>
            <div class="text">
                I am a recent college grad with a BS in Applied Physics from SUNY Geneseo.
                I am interested in software development and electronics.
                During undergrad, the projects I enjoyed most were ones where I could either work with electroncs or write code.
                My goal now is to work on projects that broaden my knowledge in those fields.
                Hopefully with this I can either continue my education to either MS or PhD, and/or become an engineer in either of these fields.

                Arduino/Raspberry Pi Weather Station
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                This is a project I worked on in 2020-2021, which unfortunately I didn't quite finish.
                Also unfortunately, since I was busy with finals before graduating,
                I forgot to document my work and left everything in a locked room somewhere at SUNY Geneseo.
                All I have left is a .ino file that I made in the early stages of the project.
                <br>
                I'll give a brief description of the project here:
                <br>
                I bought <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901">weather sensors</a> off of sparkfun,
                along with its accompanying <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13956">weather sheild</a>.
                I connnected these to an arduino and ran some code which collected data and spit it out in the serial monitor periodically.
                I had the arduino connected and being powered by a raspberry pi.
                On the pi, I wrote a python script that would take the data coming out of the serial monitor and write it to a text file.
                Then, using a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://weewx.com/">WeeWX</a> to collect the data.
                I used a method in WeeWX called "fileparse" which basically takes the data from the text file and sends it to a server.
                This data is then presented on a local site using WeeWX's default interface using apache.
                <br>
                I had more plans for the project but this is where I left off.
                Later plans included adding support to the station so it would last in more severe weather conditions,
                connecting it to a battery, solar panel, and possibly some other software improvements to get more data or improve the interface.

                This is a twitter bot that posts images every hour from the subreddit <a target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Ooer/">/r/ooer</a>.
                <br>
                Most of the posts are complete nonsense; I just wanted to learn how to make a bot in python using twitter and reddit api.
